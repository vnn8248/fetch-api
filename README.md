# fetch-api
This project was made to practice the fetch method, promise-based and arrow function syntax. 

## Front-end
Skeleton css was used for styling. 
- Get Text button fetches a local text file and outputs the text on the UI.
- Get JSON button fetches a local JSON file that has 3 sample blog posts and outputs the posts on the UI.
- Github User API Data fetches as such. The output will render the first 30 users based on ID. 

## Live Server
VS Code extension Live Server was added. It is launched for the index.html file and will auto-refresh on each save.
